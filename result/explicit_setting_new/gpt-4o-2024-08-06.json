If the character wakes up at 12 in the afternoon and decides to skip school, it implies that the exercise was in vain because it did not contribute to a productive day, as they missed school. Option 2 aligns with this scenario, as waking up late and skipping school suggests that the effort put into exercising did not lead to a successful or productive outcome."
