Since Megan ended up in daycare, it suggests a negative outcome for Lisa, which is reflected in option 1 where she is unable to sleep due to uncertainty about finding a babysitter. This aligns with the logical progression of events from seeking alternatives to the necessity of daycare. Options 0 and 3 suggest an easier transition to daycare, which contradicts the initial reluctance described in the context. Option 2 introduces a resolution through Lisa's mother's offer, which doesn't fit the scenario of Megan already being in daycare."
