Additionally, it fits the context that Gus needed to call a mechanic because his car did not start back up, preventing him from leaving. This makes option 2 the most consistent choice with the given scenario."

A likely first reaction for a cat in this situation would be to scratch at the door, trying to get attention or find a way in. Option 0 aligns with this behavior, as it describes Butters starting to scratch the door, which is a typical action for a cat trying to re-enter a house. The later part of the option, where Butters attempts to enter via the chimney, also fits with her curious and desperate nature."

The fact that the old man next to the narrator fell asleep is consistent with the context of someone nearby snoring, but it is not directly relevant to the need to lay down.

If he passed a phone repair shop and realized he could have repaired his phone for half the price, he would likely regret his purchase but still feel that, as an Apple loyalist, he had no choice but to buy a new Apple phone. Option 0 aligns with this reasoning, as it reflects both his regret and his loyalty to Apple."
