        "explanation": "The phrase \"don't meet your heroes\" implies that one's perception of a hero might change negatively upon meeting them. Option 0 suggests that the person's experience with Shane Dawson was disappointing, as he turned out to be rude. This aligns with the idea that meeting him did not live up to the expectations set by his fame, thus reflecting the meaning of the saying. Options 1, 2, and 3 do not convey a negative experience or a change in perception, making them inconsistent with the context of the saying."

After Jack finished his practice session, he would typically shower and go to sleep, as indicated by the phrase \"Once he was finished, he showered and went to sleep.\" Additionally, since Jack realized he still needed more practice after his efforts, it makes sense that he would identify areas where he needs improvement, such as being only good at dribbling with his left hand."

This directly addresses Ed's emotional state of being sad after breaking up, making it the most likely scenario to bring him happiness.

Option 2 also describes a catastrophic ending but does not emphasize the tragedy as strongly as option 0 does by mentioning \"tragically.\" Option 3 includes a catastrophic event but also mentions Nicole continuing to use the oil lamp despite the risk, which somewhat mitigates the catastrophic nature of the ending. Option 0 stands out as it explicitly uses the word \"tragically\" and emphasizes the complete destruction of Nicole's home along with her, making it the most catastrophic ending possible."

Options 0 and 3 contradict the condition of not wearing gloves, as his hands would be cold regardless of the weather conditions. Option 1 is illogical since his hands would not be warm when exposed to the cold."

Options 1 and 2 suggest that the argument was resolved amicably or dropped, which does not fit the description of Rita's behavior. Option 3 implies that Rita found supporting evidence, which contradicts her initial denial. Therefore, option 0 is the most consistent with the context and the question."

        "answer": "3",
        "explanation": "Option 3 aligns with the context where Bill is unhappy with the black lines appearing on his new TV and considers calling a repairman. This situation would likely prompt him to complain to his brother-in-law who sold him the TV. Furthermore, the sudden transformation of the black lines into something scary suggests a supernatural cause, which explains why Bill later held an exorcism. Therefore, the sister apologizing the next day makes sense as she might feel responsible for the issue that led to the exorcism."

Therefore, the cashier would likely ask why a basket is needed for more than three items, making option 0 the most appropriate as it describes an unlikely scenario given the context. Options 1, 2, and 3 all assume the purchase remains at three items, which contradicts the hypothetical addition of milk."

Since Mitsy was very hungry and the cupcake was expensive, it makes sense that her mom would give her an extra cupcake to satisfy her hunger. Additionally, the fact that her mom decided to eat the cupcake first aligns with the idea that Mitsy's mom wanted to ensure Mitsy could have her extra cupcake immediately."

Options 0 and 2 describe negative outcomes where the piles are washed away and nothing is found, which do not fit the subsequent action of starting over. Option 1 describes a positive outcome with the piles being added to, but it does not mention the washing away of the piles as asked in the question.

If friends on social media were amused by the photos Shelly uploaded the next day, it would be because the photos looked like snow (due to the white styrofoam) and the room looked messy. The mention of the youngest child choking and swallowing a piece of styrofoam suggests a dangerous situation, which contradicts the idea that friends would be amused by the photos. Therefore, option 2 is the most logical choice as it describes a scenario where the room looks like a snow scene due to the scattered styrofoam, and the child is in danger, explaining why Shelly heard him choking and realized he had swallowed a piece."

Additionally, since Kelly was upset, her friend would likely ask her brother to do something to make amends, such as cooking instant noodles as an apology. Options 0 and 2 can be ruled out because they don't match the described reaction from Kelly. Option 1 suggests that Kelly's friend wanted her brother to join in the game, which contradicts the idea that Kelly was upset. Thus, option 3 is the most logical choice."

        "explanation": "Given that Gina is described as an obedient child who cried on the way home, option 0 best fits the scenario. It shows that although Gina was sad to leave the show, she followed her mother's wishes. Additionally, it mentions that she asked her friends to tell her about the ending, which is a reasonable action for an obedient child who values the show and is eager to know what happened. Options 1 and 2 contradict the fact that Gina cried, and option 3 introduces an unusual and extreme behavior that doesn't align with her being an obedient child."

The girl sleeping with her eyes open and the narrator's immediate reaction of running out of the house screaming align well with the scenario where the narrator gets scared upon shining the light in the girl's eyes and noticing her staring without reacting. Options 0 and 3 suggest a reaction to the light hurting her eyes, which doesn't fit the scenario as well since the girl didn't react to the light. Option 2 contradicts the narrative by suggesting the girl was unfazed, which doesn't explain the narrator's fear and subsequent actions."

Options 1 and 3 imply that Alice will change her behavior permanently, which contradicts her history of sneaking around when she thinks she can get away with it.

The option that includes this action (option 2) also introduces an element of surprise (a space ship appearing in the sky) which fits well with the context of something seemingly impossible happening. Options 0 and 3 describe actions that resolve their problem too quickly, making them less plausible under the given conditions. Option 1 contradicts their desire to get a taxi by having them wait patiently."

It mentions calling emergency services, which aligns with the seriousness of the situation, and the narrator's reaction of not wanting to ride with Dan again, showing a change in attitude due to the incident. Options 0 and 2 include laughing at the situation, which contradicts the serious tone set by the narrator's condemnation. Option 1 implies they managed to dig the car out themselves, which doesn't match the condition of not having a shovel and being unable to push the car."

This option also mentions that Charles had to take a taxi and was late for work, which is consistent with the question's assumption that Charles got to work without his car. Options 1 and 2 do not fit the context as they describe the dog eating the keys, which contradicts the idea of the dog helping Charles. Option 3 does not involve the dog at all, making it inconsistent with the story's events."

        "explanation": "Option 0 is the most likely to happen if Megan ended up in a daycare. The context states that Lisa does not want to put her daughter in daycare, but as time goes on and she finds herself needing to buy drugs for insomnia, it implies that she might be desperate for relief from her situation. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that she would eventually have to consider leaving her daughter in daycare due to lack of other options. Additionally, the fact that Lisa is unable to sleep and worried about finding a babysitter supports this scenario."
