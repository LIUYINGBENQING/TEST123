Option 2 aligns with this reasoning, as it states that Harold taught himself how to fix a flat using a YouTube tutorial, ensuring he is prepared next time.

In option 2, it is mentioned that the meat in the meatloaf was infected with bacteria, suggesting that his sickness was due to food poisoning rather than the flu.

This aligns with the hypothetical condition in the question."

        "explanation": "If the giraffe had already been fed multiple times that day, it would likely have less interest in eating more. This aligns with the giraffe ignoring the grass Addie offered, which would make her sad. The option where the giraffe ignores the grass and Addie feels disappointed fits best with the hypothetical condition posed in the question. The detail about the tongue wrapping around the grass is consistent with typical giraffe behavior, even if it doesn't take the grass."
