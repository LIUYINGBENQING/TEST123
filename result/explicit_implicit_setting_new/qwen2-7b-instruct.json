Given the hypothetical scenario where Beth goes to the beach alone and realizes she forgot her sunscreen, the most logical action for her to take would be to stay under the beach umbrella to avoid sunburn and then buy a new sunscreen from a nearby store. This aligns with option 1, as it reflects the initial action of staying shaded followed by the purchase of a new sunscreen."

Additionally, it mentions that Alexa's daughter was standing next to the counter with a cookie, one in her hand and the rest on the floor, which could be the cause of the dog's stomach ache."

The next day, considering the mother's likely reaction to their late-night activity, it would make sense that she scolded them for watching the scary movie instead of praising them for being brave, as the first option suggests."
