        "options": [
            "Her brother said it was okay if Amy slept with him that night. The next day Amy's mother came in and praised the children for being brave enough to watch a scary movie.",
            "She fell asleep hiding under her bed with a flashlight. The next day Amy's mother came in and scolded the children for watching a scary movie.",
            "Her brother said it was okay if Amy slept with him that night. The next day Amy's mother came in and scolded the children for watching a scary movie.",
            "Her brother confidently went to his own room, leaving Amy to face her fears alone. The next day Amy's mother came in and scolded the children for watching a scary movie."

        ],
        "answer": "2",
        "explanation": "The context describes both Amy and her brother being scared after watching a scary movie. It is logical that they would seek comfort in each other's company, so her brother allowing Amy to sleep with him aligns with the story. The next day, their mother scolding them for watching a scary movie is a plausible consequence of their actions."
