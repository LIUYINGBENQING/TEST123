This aligns well with her goal of sharing her experience. Option 0 suggests she would want to ride the rhino, which is highly unlikely and not a typical interaction at a zoo. Option 3 contradicts her stated intention to share the experience. Option 1 does not mention taking pictures or sharing the experience, which seems inconsistent with the context provided."

Therefore, an appropriate follow-up would be that while they still miss their old friends occasionally, they find the move wasn't as bad as they thought. Options 0 and 2 do not logically follow the story's progression, as they introduce new ideas (appearance) that weren't hinted at in the context. Option 3 incorrectly suggests the narrator is fortunate due to their appearance, which isn't relevant to the story's main theme of making new friends after a move."
